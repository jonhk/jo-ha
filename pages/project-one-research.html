        <h2 class="bill_bod-pr-text-head-t-subhead-initial">Project Brief</h2>
        <p>
          The project for the semester requires you to select a restaurant in the Los Angeles area to take on as a “client.”
          Imagine that the owners of this restaurant are interested in hiring you to redesign their website. Each project in
          this class should be considered a presentation that you are making to this client: an opportunity for you to make
          your case, to get the client excited about your design work, and build “buy-in” from the “stakeholders”
          (i.e. the restaurant owners).
        </p>
        <p>
          You should start by analyzing the restaurant’s current online presence, then, over the course of the semester, you
          will design and build a fully functional and responsive website for this restaurant (to avoid trademark and copyright
          violations, you will need to rebrand and rename this restaurant as part of the website redesign).
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin this research phase of the project, complete the following:
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Analyze and study the existing restaurant website that you have chosen to redesign for the final project</li>
              <li>Organize your thoughts about what works and what doesn’t work about the current website design</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </p>
        <h2 class="bill_bod-pr-text-head-t-subhead-initial">Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Choose 3-4 websites that are competitor sites for your client (majority of the sites analyzed need to be responsive)
          and analyze the websites in the following areas: visual design, content, “call to action” on home page, navigation,
          functionality, community building (social media) and any other areas that you think play an important part in the redesign.
        </p>
        <h2 class="bill_bod-pr-text-head-t-subhead-initial">Goals & Target Audience</h2>
        <p>
          Determine Goals for the website and define the Target Audience. What are the client’s business goals for the site?
          For example, to bring more customers to the restaurant. To increase their catering business, etc. Who is the Target
          Audience? Remember: When you try to design for everyone, you design for no one. To determine answers to these questions,
          use your best judgement based on your research.
        </p>
        <p>
          Address these specific reflection prompts:
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>What questions need to be answered in order to complete this project?</li>
              <li>What tasks do we need to complete in order to successfully design this website?</li>
              <li>What issues need to be solved?</li>
              <li>What is our schedule?</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
          Pine & Crane is a Taiwanese restaurant started by chef, businessperson, and entrepreneur, Vivian Ku. Pine & Crane is located in Silver Lake, California started in 2014. The restaurant's focus is creating a restaurant focused on creating community and an authentic experience for customers to enjoy. In an online article about Vivian Ku and Pine & Crane in 2017, by Julie Wolfson for KCET, Ku states that “Growing up with the noodles my grandmother would make, all of my friends would like it regardless of their race,” she remembers. “Flavored with soy sauce, and savory. Noodles are so comforting. It’s very universal. That’s what drew me to Taiwanese cuisine. There is a big enough demographic that would be open to try it. It has to be authentic, but also for people to still enjoy it.” Currently Ku runs three restaurants in Los Angeles, CA: Pine & Crane in Silver Lake, JOY in Highland Park, and Chinatown.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, the website follows a simple and clear color scheme: Black, Gray, and White. It follows a card / block organizational hierarchy in a one page website design and uses a Squarespace template for the design. It uses Raleway font “designed by Matt McInerney as a single thin weight, it was expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida in 2012 and iKerned by Igino Marini,” (Google Fonts) uppercase for the navigation items. The navigation items use a dark grey and the paragraph uses sentence case. The paragraph below the navigation detailing the circumstances in how their restaurant operates during COVID-19 is in a lighter grey and uses <strong></strong> for emphasized content. The navigation has the Pine & Crane logo in the middle and the navigation divided into a section on the left and a section on the right. The logo is an illustrated logo of a Crane standing on a Pine tree surrounded by a circular container with a stroke.
        </p>
        <img class="bill_bod-pr-text-head-img" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Emxkoi-nsph4gNfTigERs5RRmfc=/0x0:1000x667/1200x800/filters:focal(420x254:580x414)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/50543711/03_2014_PINE_AND_CRANE-36_JPG.0.0.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
          On the left side the navigation items are: “COVID-19, MENU, ABOUT US, HOURS & LOCATION,” (Pine & Crane website) and on the right: “DELIVERY & TAKEOUT, CATERING, GIFT CARDS, CONTACT,” (Pine & Crane website). When you scroll the navigation uses sticky navigation as it touches an image slideshow of their storefront and food. The website is responsive. When using the mobile layout or a reduced window width size of about 768px by 719px, it converts to a hamburger menu layout and the logo reduces in size. Until it matches the minimum width, the logo moves to the top of the navigation and the navigation items wrap below the logo.
        </p>
        <p>
          It follows a single page layout with anchor links linking from each navigation item. The content blocks are separated by color and content type. The structure has the COVID-19 update at the top followed by the image slideshow. Beneath, is the full menu with images of each page and an “ABOUT US” block. This block section is in a light grey background. The content above used white as the background. The section features two columns, on the left three images of dishes from the restaurant and the storefront, and on the left an about section with the mission statement and information about the restaurant. Below is a Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) section, describing seating (first-come, first-serve; ordering; and questions about seating in public spaces) and further questions. The block below has a background color of white with a two column structure similar to the section above. On the left, is the address of the restaurant and the hours of the restaurant on each day. On the right is the map through Google Maps of the location with a pin. Below is a block for Delivery & Takeout in a light grey background, a Catering block in white with a phone number and email to contact for catering, a Gift Cards block with a light grey background, and a Contact form block with a white background. The Delivery & Takeout, Gift Cards, and Contact blocks all use buttons. The Delivery & Takeout and Gift Cards blocks lead to purchase options and the Contact block features a submit button. The footer block is divided into two sections: the first has a dark grey background with the addresses for the sister restaurant and pop-up, and the second section uses a darker grey background with the address of Pine & Crane.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of the benefits of one page design structure with the block system: the website is clear to use. The minimalistic structure makes it easier to find the content without having to click to another section of the website, which could affect user interaction. With a sticky header you can easily scroll from section to section. The navigation structure is clear allowing the user to find the content and what they are looking for easily. This makes it efficient for customers to use the website to find what they need: whether it is ordering food, or finding the location. In terms of the drawbacks of this design structure: using this design can make for a long website. It cuts off the image slideshow and while the intention can make the website minimalistic it can sometimes make it too minimal that it can make the website feel more like another Squarespace website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall the website's clean and simple design has some benefits and drawbacks that were important to analyze in order to understand as a designer for the restaurant website redesign project. I feel that their consistent brand design allows us as users to feel a sense of continuity and clarity when visiting the website. I feel that the organization and minimalism of the website works really well and provides clarity on information to allow customers to visit, order, and learn more about the restaurant.

        <p>KILLER wine packages this week. First up, Australia/New Zealand pack, which includes a MAGNUM of Lucy Margaux and Kindeli’s Luna Nueva, about which NM Wine Director @mkepling says: “A sublime and seductive blend of Viognier, Pinot Blanc & Gris, and Sauvignon Blanc.

Next up: OG NIGHT+MARKET winemakers. These are the folks who were on our first wine list ten years ago (yes, it’s our 10th birthday this fall!) and have stayed on ever since. All Loire producers, including benchmark Pet-Nat from @pascalpotaire, 1 chenin and 2 gamay (of course). $115. To order, email info@nightmarketla.com by 5pm Thursday for delivery or pick up Friday.

First up, Australia/New Zealand pack, which includes a MAGNUM of Lucy Margaux and Kindeli’s Luna Nueva, about which NM Wine Director @mkepling says: “A sublime and seductive blend of Viognier, Pinot Blanc & Gris, and Sauvignon Blanc. Partial skin contact and amphora aging leads to a beguiling departure from the ubiquitous New Zealand style. Like a succulent luau of grilled pineapples, honeysuckle, passionfruit and herbs.” $150. Next up: OG NIGHT+MARKET winemakers. These are the folks who were on our first wine list ten years ago (yes, it’s our 10th birthday this fall!) and have stayed on ever since. All Loire producers, including benchmark Pet-Nat from @pascalpotaire, 1 chenin and 2 gamay (of course). $115. To order, email info@nightmarketla.com by 5pm Thursday for delivery or pick up Friday. Thank you!

        <p>KILLER wine packages this week. First up, Australia/New Zealand pack, which includes a MAGNUM of Lucy Margaux and Kindeli’s Luna Nueva, about which NM Wine Director @mkepling says: “A sublime and seductive blend of Viognier, Pinot Blanc & Gris, and Sauvignon Blanc. Partial skin contact and amphora aging leads to a beguiling departure from the ubiquitous New Zealand style. Like a succulent luau of grilled pineapples, honeysuckle, passionfruit and herbs.” $150. Next up: OG NIGHT+MARKET winemakers. These are the folks who were on our first wine list ten years ago (yes, it’s our 10th birthday this fall!) and have stayed on ever since. All Loire producers, including benchmark Pet-Nat from @pascalpotaire, 1 chenin and 2 gamay (of course). $115. To order, email info@nightmarketla.com by 5pm Thursday for delivery or pick up Friday. Thank you!
